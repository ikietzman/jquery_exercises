1) Set up jQuery
2) Set up your own custom script file
3) Wrap your script in the jQuery document.ready function so that it only executes once the page is ready.
4) On page load, perform the following operations:
    Hide the author heading
    Show the date heading
    Slide the header element onto the page
    Fade the first paragraph element off the page
    Add a class to the second paragraph element that applies at least one custom style.
    Set the content of the third paragraph to something new -- a single word in the new content should be bold or italic.
    Log the height of the <body> element, including padding, to the console.
    Add one more paragraph after the final paragraph in <main>
    Add a <div> that contains an image before <main>
5) Add a button to the page that, when clicked, toggles the presence of a class that defines a background color on the <main> element.
6) Add a button before the fourth paragraph in <main>. When clicked, this button should slide the fourth paragraph up or down, depending on whether it is currently visible or not.
7) Add a jQuery event listener such that when the user presses the 'm' key the font-size of paragraph content increases by 1px. Add a similar function that decreases by 1px when the user presses the 'n' key.
8) When the user clicks anywhere in the footer, animate the link in the footer to the right by 50px over a period of two seconds.
9) When the user clicks the Submit button below the text input, log the value of the input box to the console.

10) Select one of the paragraphs in <main> then use the parent() method to add a class to <main>. This class should apply some noticeable style to the <main> element.
11) Select the <ul> on your page, then use the children() selector to add a class to each of the list items. This class should apply some noticeable style to the list items.
12) Select the <body> element, then use the find() method and another jQuery method to add a plus sign or an asterisk to the beginning of every element on the page.
13) Select the first paragraph element in <main>, then use the siblings() method to add a class to all paragraph elements at the same level in the DOM tree.
14) Create a button, then when that button is clicked select the second paragraph element in <main>, then use the .prev() and .next() methods to toggle a class on the first and third paragraph elements. This class should apply a noticeable style.
15) When the user presses the space bar, toggle a class on all html elements that are children of <body> and are not() a <footer> element.
16) Create a button that when clicked selects <main> then use the first() and last() methods to fade in the first and last paragraphs inside <main> if they aren't visible and fade out those same elements if they are visible.

17) use .load() to make and AJAX call to and insert the contents of https://tallgrassschool.com/cohort_3/data/students.html to a new html div located right before the <footer> element. Give your .load() method a callback that logs a message to the console when the method is completed.
18) user $.getJSON() to make an AJAX call to https://tallgrassschool.com/cohort_3/data/people.json. In the callback make a for loop to build a div for each in the people array that contains the name and favorite holiday of that person, stick those divs in the DOM somewhere, then log a message to the console once that the process is completed.
