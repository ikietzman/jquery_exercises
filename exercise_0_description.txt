1) Set up jQuery
2) Set up your own custom script file
3) Wrap your script in the jQuery document.ready function so that it only executes once the page is ready.
4) On page load, perform the following operations:
    Hide the author heading
    Show the date heading
    Slide the header element onto the page
    Fade the first paragraph element off the page
    Add a class to the second paragraph element that applies at least one custom style.
    Set the content of the third paragraph to something new -- a single word in the new content should be bold or italic.
    Log the height of the <body> element, including padding, to the console.
    Add one more paragraph after the final paragraph in <main>
    Add a <div> that contains an image before <main>
5) Add a button to the page that, when clicked, toggles the presence of a class that defines a background color on the <main> element.
6) Add a button before the fourth paragraph in <main>. When clicked, this button should slide the fourth paragraph up or down, depending on whether it is currently visible or not.
7) Add a jQuery event listener such that when the user presses the 'm' key the font-size of paragraph content increases by 1px. Add a similar function that decreases by 1px when the user presses the 'n' key.
8) When the user clicks anywhere in the footer, animate the link in the footer to the right by 50px over a period of two seconds.
9) When the user clicks the Submit button below the text input, log the value of the input box to the console.
